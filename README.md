- 👋 Hi, I’m @Anthony-0801 👋
- 👀 I’m interested in many things like biking, reading, travelling, learning and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript in preparation for tackling the Web Development path, but I'd also want to tackle Data/Business Analytics path so next time you'll see some of my related works here ✨
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone who'd like to teach me as I'm a learner, an ever-learning one ✨
- 📫 How to reach me? I'll update this soon
